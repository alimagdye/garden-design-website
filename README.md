# Garden Design Company Website

This project is a website for a garden design company that specializes in garden design, creation, maintenance, and landscaping. I designed this responsive website, incorporating an interactive image slider and portfolio gallery, which demonstrates my ability to create visually appealing, user-friendly websites that can enhance user engagement and improve customer experience. The website includes sections such as Home, Services, Portfolio, About Us, and Contact.


## Features
