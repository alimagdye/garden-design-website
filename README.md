# Garden Landscaping Company Website

This project is a website for a garden lanscaping company that specializes in garden design, creation, maintenance, and landscaping. I designed this website using best UI practices and AI-assisted design for optimal aesthetics, incorporating an interactive image slider and portfolio gallery and  I implemented these designs in using HTML, CSS and I'm currently working in improving its interactivity using JS. I made the website responsive to 300px width devices. I used semantic tags to ensure accessibility. I used many meta tags to obtain the SEO, so I can higher the rank of the website when it's searched on Google. and made the website responsive to 300px width devices, this demonstrates my ability to create visually appealing, user-friendly websites that can enhance user engagement and improve customer experience. The website includes sections such as Home, Services, Portfolio, About Us, and Contact.
